      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p class="story-text">It all began with a simple friendship, sparked by our shared love for collectibles. Our conversations soon revealed a mutual passion for Hironos, which inspired us to create a business we proudly named Popcatâ€”a nod to our affection for cats.</p>
      <p class="story-text">Starting with just one box, we quickly realized that our venture was about more than just generating income; we were also brightening people's lives by delivering joy through collectibles. As months passed, we felt compelled to extend our mission beyond the business. We began feeding stray cats and providing them with essential vitamins, understanding that our support could make a significant difference in their lives.</p>

        <div class="photo-item"><img src="cat2.jpg" alt="Cat 2"></div>
        <div class="photo-item"><img src="cat3.jpg" alt="Cat 3"></div>
        <div class="photo-item"><img src="cat4.jpg" alt="Cat 4"></div>

        <div class="photo-item"><img src="cat6.jpg" alt="Cat 6"></div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="story-text">Now, through Popcat, we not only assist fellow collectors in finding their sought-after items without the burdens of international shipping fees or taxes, but we also strive to help stray cats survive on the streets.</p>
      
      <p class="story-text-last">We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has believed in us and supported our journey. Your trust and encouragement have made it possible for us to extend our reach and impact not just the collector community but also the lives of these vulnerable animals. Together, we are making a difference!</p>
